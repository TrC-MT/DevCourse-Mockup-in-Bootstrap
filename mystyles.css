/* I'm realizing now that I probably should have tried to make this in scss. I could have saved some lines of code in color, and apparently edited the bootstrap properties easier.
Ah well, it was nice coding in HTML and CSS again after doing mostly Python for a year. The more I learn, the better (and happier) I am. I'm grateful for the things I'm learning, and can't wait to use them profesionally. */
